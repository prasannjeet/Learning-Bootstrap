        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>In data mining, k-means clustering is a method of cluster analysis which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.<br><br>
            The K-means algorithm is the most commonly used partition clustering algorithm because it can be easily implemented and is the most efficient one in terms of the execution time. The major problem with this algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial partition and may converge to local optima. The partitioning method constructs k partitions of the data, where each partition represents a cluster and k â‰¤ n (data objects). It classifies the data into k groups, which together satisfy the following requirements:<br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Each group must contain at least one object</li>
            <li>Each object must belong to exactly one group.</li>
        </ol>
        Due to its simplicity in application k-means clustering has acquired a lot of attention from scholars. Also, the degree of flexibility available is very high. Thus, a large number of papers proposing modified and more efficient versions of k-means has been presented.<br><br>
        Some papers focus on developing a more efficient way of initial seed selection1, some focus on decreasing the runtime of algorithm using data structures to store the computations performed by the algorithm in previous iterations thus saving overhead2. Some papers propose a more efficient way of dividing the domain space of data points3. Other papers propose methods by which algorithm need not be initialized with required number of clusters rather they are determined dynamically6.<br><br>
        In this report, we primarily focus on deciding which amongst the two-mentioned k-means algorithms are better by comparing the average intra cluster distance inside clusters. This experiment does not take into account other parameters such as the efficiency or order of the algorithm.
