        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            Having access to a Wi-Fi router is always preferred by someone who uses internet extensively, and considering the fact that in current day and age, in any developed country, it’s easy to find numerous private Wi-Fi networks in any populated neighborhood, it would be very helpful for netizens if they could connect to one of these networks by paying a nominal fee which would definitely be lesser than the current exorbitant mobile data charges. Various methods have been proposed to decrease mobile broadband cost, however nothing has been implemented yet.<br><br>
            A few previously proposed techniques to convert a private router to public Wi-Fi hotspot are discussed in this project plan, along with a brief idea on Software Defined Networking, a relatively new technology which makes it very easy to work with routers, and networks on the whole.<br><br>
            This project plan is broadly divided into seven parts, namely background, motivation, problem statement, research question, method, “expected results and contributions” and references. In sections background and motivation, we discuss the public behavior of internet usage while on a mobile data vs while on a Wi-Fi network and explain why this project is important. Problem statement lists out the problem which is faced by many due to lack of enough Wi-Fi hotspots. We then try to formulate a research question for this project; then we briefly delineate the tentative standard operating procedure that is planned to be followed throughout the project, in the methods section. We finally end the report with “expected results and contributions” and the references section.<br><br>
