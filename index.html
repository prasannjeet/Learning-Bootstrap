        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>At ManualPik, we feel that user manuals are most underrated and undervalued items that ship along with any product we buy. In the excitement of receiving a new electronic product, be it a new 56-Inch OLED Display Television or a Home Theater System, we tend to overlook one of the most important document shipped with it. Let’s take an example of a Home-Theater System: the first installation is always smooth as we have the product manual handy, but when someone relocates to a new house, she/he faces huge problems in reinstalling it, as the last time they did it was a few years ago and they do not have the user manual with them anymore. Apart from a handful of obsessive compulsive, or hugely organized people, we will hardly find anyone with a “User-Manual-Drawer” at their home, where they keep all the user manuals together. Most of the time they end up in various drawers in the house, or in the pile of old newspapers waiting to be thrown or recycled. Some people preserve manuals only because they plan to re-sell their products at a later stage.
            <br><br>Thus, we clearly see a common trend here: people lose or misplace their product manuals and never find it when they actually need them. Moreover, in this era of digitization, when even signatures are digitized in many countries (Adobe Systems Incorporated, 2017), we at ManualPik aim to get rid of physical copies of user manuals by digitally storing all of them at a single place – manualpik.com.
